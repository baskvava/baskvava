## 🚨 STOP SCROLLING! Check This Out 👇

I am currently pouring my energy into building **[AI Interview Coach](https://github.com/baskvava/ai-interview-coach)**, a project that redefines how developers prepare for technical interviews. 

**Why you should care (and Star 🌟 it):**
Most AI tools just give you the answer. **AI Interview Pro** is different—it acts like a **Socratic Coach**. It guides you through the problem-solving process without spoiling the solution, simulating a *real* FAANG-style interview experience.

### 🔥 [AI Interview Coach](https://github.com/baskvava/ai-interview-coach) Highlights:

|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Guides you with hints, doesn't just write code for you. | Generates unique algo problems & test cases on the fly. | Analyze Big O complexity & code quality instantly. |
